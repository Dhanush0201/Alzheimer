1. This project's objective is to create a machine learning framework for earliest stages of Alzheimer's detection using brain MRI scans.

2. Alzheimer's dementia, often known as dementia, is a neurological condition that eventually results in death by impairing cognition and causing memory loss.
 
3. Early disease detection is crucial for the creation of efficient cures and tactics to halt the expanding severity of Alzheimer's disease.

4. The use of MRI, a secure imaging method, may assist in identifying the early notice of dementia by giving vital details on the physiological and anatomical morphology of the brain.

5. The objective is to develop a model for machine learning that can precisely classify MRI images as either originating from a healthy individual or from a person with Alzheimer's disease using data from database of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

Data loading: Import the dataset containing the classes that agree to the photos in the dataset. Verify the dataset's labelling to prevent misclassification.

Data splitting: The dataset was divided into sets for training and validation so as to assess how well the CNN model performed.

Building the model: utilizing deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras, create a CNN model utilizing transfer learning strategy. 

Train the CNN model: On the training data using the fit technique to find patterns in the images and correctly classify them.

Model evaluation: Look for over- or underfitting by analyzing the CNN model's performance in validation data set. Save the CNN model to a disc if you want to use it for deployment or predictions in the future. 

Model construction: To achieve the best performance, configure the model with the proper optimizer, evaluation metric, and loss function.

GUI: Create a GUI window using the appropriate toolkit, Tkinter, to provide a user-friendly interface. The GUI window should be given labels and buttons so that users can submit photos and receive predictions by adding a widget.

Image processing: Scale, normalise, or resize the uploaded image to make it fit the input layer's dimensions. Utilise the predict technique and the CNN model that was previously trained to determine the class of the submitted image.

Results display: Change the results label in the GUI panel to match the intended class.
